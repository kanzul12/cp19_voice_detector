EXAMPLES OF TIME LIBRARY:

In this project we use time.sleep() function to stop or pause duration of speech to display on screen.


1.
import time

print "Start : %s" % time.ctime()
time.sleep( 5 )
print "End : %s" % time.ctime()


2.

for count in range(5):
    print(time.ctime())
    # Prints the current time with a five second difference
    time.sleep(5)
